00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Oh? What? What is this?
Oh! This music! Oooh!

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Ah! Jafar! You have to come see this!

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:22.000
[Choir] Make way for Prince Ali!
What grace, Prince Ali!

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000
[Genie] You lucky people,
Clear the mess.
And you'll see,
What you're about to see.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Come applaud, cheer the Superstar!
Celebrate this great day, Bells and drums,
Come adore the idol!

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Prince Ali, His Lordship, Ali Ababwa.
Kneel, bow down, Be delighted!

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:55.000
No panic, let's calm down!
Shout long live Ali, Salam!
Come see the most beautiful show in Arabia.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:04.000
Prince Ali, stronger than him,
I don't know any.
Who carries you from Abu Dhabi, single-handedly.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:13.000
He defeated an army,
All alone with his sword!
The terror of enemies, that's Prince Ali!

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.000
[Choir] He has a hundred and three camels and camels...
[Genie] Aren't they cute, Simone?

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
[Choir] Caravans of peacocks from Ispahan
[Genie] Absolutely, I love their feathers.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:29.000
Gorillas that protect him with their wings.
This zoo is a market,
Horn of the goat!
It's a super menagerie!

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:42.000
Prince Ali, yes it's him, Ali Ababwa!
What a physique, it's magnificent,
He's charming. There's a crowd on the balcony,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:48.000
Me, I have a veil on my chin.
And everyone faints for Prince Ali.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:02:01.000
[Choir]
Come see his two hundred Persian monkeys.
It's paying, and yet it's free,
Servants and slaves work for him,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:09.000
Proud to serve him, he's the greatest,
We obey him, and each would give his life,
For Ali... Long live Ali!

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:21.000
[Genie] Prince Ali, yes it's him,
Ali Ababwa, is here, for your daughter, so pretty.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.000
That's why, in procession,
This lover besieges you.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:32.000
[Choir] With thirty elephants playing acrobats,
Bears and then lions, to the sound of the trumpet.
His forty fakirs, his battery of chefs,

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:41.000
His birds that cry,
Make way for Prince Ali!

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
Splendid! Absolutely marvelous!
